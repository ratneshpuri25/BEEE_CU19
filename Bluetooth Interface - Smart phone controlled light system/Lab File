Theory:
Concept Used:The Bluetooth will work with an Arduino board through the serial communication.
The data is received to the Arduino with the HC-05 Bluetooth module through the serial communication and the LED's will turn
ON/OFF according to the receiving data.

Learning Observations:
We got to know how bluetooth works.
We also learned how we can connect bluetooth throgh our mobile and can control blinking of LED.
Observations:
We observed the synchronous between hardware and software.
LED turns ON when on pressong on and turns OFF when pressed sand it's controlled using smart phonr.

Problems and Trouble shotting:
We have to select the right port and the type of arduino.
We have to make all connections tight.
We have to make connections according to the code.
We should calso check teh contuinity of the circuit and the flow of the current.

Preacutions:
All tools should be handeled carefully.
Never connect arduino till the circuit is complete.
Also choose the right port and the right arduino.

Result:
LED is turned ON and OFF using smart phone.
