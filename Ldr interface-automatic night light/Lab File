Theory:
Conecept Used:It senses the light from the surroundings and finds whether it's day or night.
It turns ON the light when it's darrk felse it's OFF.

Learning Objective:
We have to learn about the concept of LDR and how to use it in real life.

Observations:
We observed the synchronous between hardware and software.
We also observed that when it's dark the LED automatically turns ON and when it's daylight it remains OFF.

Problems and Trouble shotting:
We have to select the right port and the type of arduino.
We have to make all connections tight.
We have to make connections according to the code.
We should calso check teh contuinity of the circuit and the flow of the current.

Preacutions:
All tools should be handeled carefully.
Never connect arduino till the circuit is complete.
Also choose the right port and the right arduino.

Result:
Automatic night lamp functioning was verified after uploading the program.
