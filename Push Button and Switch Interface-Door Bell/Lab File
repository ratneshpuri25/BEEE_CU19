Theory:
Concept Used:Whenever the switch is pressed teh bell rings.

Learning Objectives:
We learnes how to ring a door bell using arduino.

Observations:
We observed the synchronous between hardware and software.
Also observed the ringing of bell when pressed the switch.

Problems and Trouble shotting:
We have to select the right port and the type of arduino.
We have to make all connections tight.
We have to make connections according to the code.
We should calso check teh contuinity of the circuit and the flow of the current.

Preacutions:
All tools should be handeled carefully.
Never connect arduino till the circuit is complete.
Also choose the right port and the right arduino.

Outcomes:
Bell is ringing when the switch is pressed.
