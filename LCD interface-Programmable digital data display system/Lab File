Theory:
Concept Used:

Learning Observations:
We observed the synchronous between hardware and software.
We have learned how to display anything in LED with the help of arduino.

Problems and Trouble shotting:
We have to select the right port and the type of arduino.
We have to make all connections tight.
We have to make connections according to the code.
We should calso check the contuinity of the circuit and the flow of the current.

Preacutions:
All tools should be handeled carefully.
Never connect arduino till the circuit is complete.
Also choose the right port and the right arduino.

Result:
Programmable Digital Data Display system was verified after uploading the program.
