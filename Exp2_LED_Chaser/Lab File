Theory:
Concept Used:
Here we have use Kirchoff's voltage law and Kirchoff's current law. Also we have learnt how to make  series and parallel conncection in
bredboard.

Learning Observations:
We have learn't how to make series and parallel connection in bredboard and wiring.
Also got to know how to control ardruino and it's codings.

Observations:
We observed the synchronise between softwared and hardware. 
Also observed the led blinking pattern and in cahsing from.

Problems and Troubleshotting:
We have to select the right port and the type of arduino.
We have to make all connections toght if any connections will be left loose the circuit will not  completed.
We should also check connections according to code.
We shuld also check contuinity of circuit and flow of current in the circuit.

Precautions:
All tools should be handeled carefully.
Never connect arduino till the circuit is not complete.
Also choose the right port and right arduino.

Outcomes:
LED's are glowing in chasing pattern.
This pattern can be used for decoration in marriges nadd many other functions.
