Theory:

Concept Used:
An Ultrasonic Sensor is a device that measures distance to an object using Sound Waves. It works by sending out a sound wave at ultrasonic
frequency and waits for it to bounce back from the object.

Learning Observations:
We learned conccept about the ultrasonic sensors.
We also learned it's practical uses in the real world.

Observations:
We observed the synchronous between hardware and software.
Also observed how sensor behaves when it senses any obstacle in it's path.

Problems and Trouble shotting:
We have to select the right port and the type of arduino.
We have to make all connections tight.
We have to make connections according to the code.
We should calso check teh contuinity of the circuit and the flow of the current.

Preacutions:
All tools should be handeled carefully.
Never connect arduino till the circuit is complete.
Also choose the right port and the right arduino.

Result:
Programmable Ultrasonic Sensor Interface  system was verified after uploading the program.
